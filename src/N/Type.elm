{-| You might want a function, where one `N-X-Nat` should be at least as big as another one.

    unsafeInterval : NaturalNumber first -> NaturalNumber last -> Interval

We want to promise that

    last == first + the interval length

which means

    first == last - the interval length

â†’ `N first Is (Difference intervalLength To last)` is our final type!

    safeInterval :
        NNat (N first Is (Difference interval To last))
        -> NNat (N last Is difference)
        -> Interval
